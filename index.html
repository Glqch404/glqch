I like open world games cuz you are free to do anything in them! im also currently learning Java Thanks to my friend Grcq who encouraged me. I dont play any sports, just your basic basketball at school, I kinda like swimming. Im kinda fun to be around, but am still single and intend to keep It that way, Bye.  </h3>
